Guardians of the Galaxy Demo
=================================================

What is it?
-----------
This is a `SystemOfUnits` implementation based on a [Reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/1ye9ty/i_calculated_the_heights_and_weights_of_the/) calculating the heights and weights of the Guardians Of The Galaxy and a JUnit test suite for each character.

We also added **Fat Thor** anticipating "Guardians of the Galaxy 3" where he might  play a role again, based on Chris Hemsworth's height and estimated weight (220lb) plus the [fat suit](https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28566566/chris-hemsworth-fat-thor-avengers-endgame-behind-the-scenes/) he was wearing in "Avengers Endgame".
If you would like to calculate Fat Thor's BMI, please also check out [UoM Health Demos](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/uom-demos/tree/master/domain/health) ;-D
